Abstract
--------

Jedective is a text parser written in Java and is licensed under http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html[GPL] license. 
It's purpose is to locate cellphones in a given set of (html) files and 
then match them with names (possible owners).

Jedective is implemented for Greek cellphones and names!

Project Goal
------------

The goal of this project is to conclude if the Greek internet user group
is protecting appropriately it's personal information (such as name,surname
,home address,phone,cellphone,e.t.c.).

In order to conclude the above we are parsing Greek web pages for important
personal informations, more precisely with cellphones and correlate them 
with individuals.

Getting Started
---------------

To start downloading a corpus of Greek webpages and parse them with
jedective read the link:readme.html[Getting Started Guide]

How it works
------------

Jedective is written in Java.

The parsing consists of the following steps:

. We feed it with an html file or a set of html files.
. Reads the html files one by one.
. Converts the html into plain text with the http://jericho.htmlparser.net/docs/index.html[jericho API].
. Parses the text until it finds a cellphone.
. Tries to find greek names or surnames before and after the cellphone.
. Creates a log with the search results.

=== How it finds the Greek names ===

Jedective has its own database of Greek names (entities.GreekNames.java).
It consists of all common greek names found http://www.foundalis.com/grk/EllinikaOnomata.html[here].
The names have been modified with regex in order to have better results
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming[stemming]).

For finding Greek surnames jedective also uses regex with the most common
Greek surnames prefixes and postfixes.

=== Further convertion ===

Except the html to text conversion jedective also removes other stopwards
such as punctuation to accomplish better results.
